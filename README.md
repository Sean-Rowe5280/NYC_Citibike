# NYC_Citibike

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze trends among Citi Bike users in the New York City market to determine if a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To understand this we need to understand the Citi Bike cutomers and their habits; whos using Citi bike, when they're usings it, and for how long. We used **Tableau**, which is an incredible visualization tool, to breakdown these fundamental questions.  Using this powerful tool we drilled down into the data to visually uncover trends between customers and their use of Citi Bike. 

### Key Visualizations:
- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary
Our visualization uncovered a number of important trends in the Data. First that Subscribers account for the largest portion of Citi Bikes business in NYC with 81% of users.  We also see that men use Citi Bike far more than any other group accounting for 65% of rides followed by women(25%) and unkown(10%). Understanding your customer demographic is important in getting any business off the ground, we know that men are the biggest users which is a good start but more information such as age, income, housing, type of employement would go a long way. The subcription model is increasingly ubiquitous, we see it in meal services, clothing companies and just about every online service. Determining a price, or tiered subscription plan to maximize subscribers would help get customers to subsribe and duplicate the NYC Citi Bikes success in Des Moines.  To maximize this again more information and anlayisis on the Des Moines market would be valuable. The last trend we uncovered looks at average trip durations and peak times for rides. We can see that vast majority of rides are less than one hour, with the bulk of those rides under the 30 minute mark, and 5-6 minute short rides being the most popular. Keeping this in mind its important to locate bike stations strategically so they arent too far apart. The majority of users wont ride an hour or even 30 minutes to another bike station so the location is key. We also know that users use Citi Bike to commute to and from work, we know this as use peaks in the morning and evening times. It would be smart to locate stations, at least inititally, in the denser parts of Desmoines where folks both work and live in close proximity. To fully understand the viability of Citi Bike in Des Moines we need more information about the city, where people live, where they work, income data, etc.  Its also critical to understand a less tangible aspect of the city which is the culture.

Suggestions for Future Analysis:
1. Maps of Des Moines using Mapbox to display population density and household income be incredibly useful in determining bike station location.
2. Bar chart visualizing Citi Bike use in NYC according to different age brackets and an additional bar chart and map of desmoine displaying the various age demographics.
