# NYC_Citibike

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze trends among Citi Bike users in the New York City market to determine if a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To understand this we need to understand the Citi Bike cutomers and their habits; whos using Citi bike, when they're usings it, and for how long. We used **Tableau**, which is an incredible visualization tool, to breakdown these fundamental questions.  Using this powerful tool we drilled down into the data to visually uncover trends between customers and their use of Citi Bike. 

### Key Visualizations:
- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary
Our visualization uncovered a number of important trends in the Data. First that Subscribers account for the largest portion of Citi Bikes business in NYC with 81% of users.  The subcription model is increasingly ubiquitous, we see it in meal services, clothing companies and just about every online service. Determining a way to maximize subscribers such a tiered priceing model would help duplicate Citi Bikes success in Des Moines. We also see that men use Citi Bike far more than any other group accounting for 65% of rides followed by women(25%) and unkown(10%). Understanding your customer demographic is important in getting any business off the ground, we know that men are the biggest users which is a good start but more information such as age, income, housing, type of employement would go a long way. The last trends we uncovered look at average trip durations and peak times for rides. We can see that vast majority of rides are less than one hour, with the bulk of those under the 30 minute mark, and 5-6 minute(short) rides being the most popular. Keeping this in mind its important to locate bike stations strategically so they arent too far apart. The majority of users wont ride an hour or even 30 minutes to another bike station so the location is key. We also know that users use Citi Bike to commute to and from work, we know this as ustilization peaks in the morning and evening times. It would be smart to locate stations, at least inititally, in the denser parts of Desmoines where folks both work and live in close proximity. To fully understand the viability of Citi Bike in Des Moines we need more information about the city, where people live, where they work, income data, etc.  Its also critical to understand a less tangible factors such as city culture.

Suggestions for Future Analysis:
1. Maps of Des Moines using Mapbox to display population density and household income could be incredibly useful in determining feasibilty and ultimately bike station location.
2. Bar chart visualizing Citi Bike use in NYC for various age brackets and an additional bar chart and map of Des Moines displaying the same information. Would again allow us to further evaluate feasibily and if the project was given the green light locate stations appropriately.
